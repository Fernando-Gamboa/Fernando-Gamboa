I am a software engineer passionate about developing web applications. I enjoy new challenges and understanding/learning new technologies. I am drawn to the rapid constant change the tech industry is known for, as well as the collaborative and problem-solving aspects.

When I'm not coding you can find me hiking, reading, or trying out new food places 🍔
